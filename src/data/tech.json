        "description": "Blockchain doesn't have a central authority. It ensures trust of data by maintaining a decentralized ledger. Nodes are responsible for verifying data and putting it in a block and then store it on the blockchain. Nodes also store details about the origin of the data block thus ensuring data integrity. This verification process makes data recorded on the blockchain trustworthy."

        "description": "Blockchain is transparent, making data available to anyone and it uses consensus algorithms for data verification. Its’ network is largely distributed due to the fact that all nodes keep a copy of the ledger. In order to modify data on the blockchain, nodes must be pooled together to create a consensus. This mechanism makes it almost impossible for a criminal to alter data."
