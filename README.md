# Why blockchain data matter

## Integrity

Blockchain doesn't have a central authority. It ensures trust of data by maintaining a decentralized ledger. Nodes are responsible for verifying data and putting it in a block and then store it on the blockchain. Nodes also store details about the origin of the data block thus ensuring data integrity. This verification process makes data recorded on the blockchain trustworthy.

## Immutability

Blockchain is transparent, making data available to anyone and it uses consensus algorithms for data verification. Its’ network is largely distributed due to the fact that all nodes keep a copy of the ledger. In order to modify data on the blockchain, nodes must be pooled together to create a consensus. This mechanism makes it almost impossible for a criminal to alter data.

## DeFi

Decentralized finance is an ecosystem of financial applications that are built on top of blockchain. Making use of all the blockchain data available people can create their own defi application or they can use an existing one, depending on the use case they are looking for: from lending and borrowing coins, to locking their own coins in order to make a profit.

## Analysis

Analysing blockchain data can reveal valuable insights into the behaviours, trends, social sentiments etc. Making real-time analysis of data on a large scale is a powerful tool that can be used to predict with good accuracy future outcomes.

## Privacy

Some blockchains offer privacy by using a protocol called zero-knowledge proof that has embedded some complex cryptographic methods that don’t reveal any information about the data except the fact that it is valid.

# Why wizard spells matter

## Good spells

The wizard's library isn't controlled by anyone and sorcerers work to maintain it. All spells written in the books are good because the sorcerers check every spell before writing it. Details of the origin for every book is kept to ensure the integrity of spells, so you can trust that whatever spell you pick is a good one.

## No cheating

The game will always be fair because the wizard's library is open to all magical creatures in the realm. If a player wants to cheat and change a spell in one of the books, he must find a way to fool the Council of Sorcerers. It is pretty impossible to do that because all members of the council keep copies to prevent such malicious acts.

## Unicorns

Unicorns exist. You can create your own unicorn by combining the right spells or you can use one already created. Even though unicorns have unique traits, they all revolve around gold. Some will give you the ability to lend your gold, some to borrow and others will let you lock your gold in order to increase it over time.

## True sight

Looking a little closer at the spells might reveal the true nature of the magical creatures that performed them. The one harnessing this power could get a glimpse of what the future holds and might predict their next move.

## Invisibility

There are wizards that keep in their libraries invisible spells. Those spells are still good abut a magic cloak is used and is able to conceal details about each spell and only keep the proof that the spell is good.
